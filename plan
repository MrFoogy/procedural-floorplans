Crossover:

Randomly permute the order of the nodes in the adjacency matrices

Select cutoff point

Swap lower-right sections

Delete invalid connections

Find spanning tree

Determine how many edges each should have

Fill edges first according to spanning tree, then add/remove at random.



How to randomly permute rows and columns?

How to randomly generate a spanning tree?
- (Randomly select one row (whose node is not yet connected) for each column and add a 1? And if 	below the diagonal line, instead insert in the appropriate location.

Should an exterior really be used???

Fitness function:

Adjacency preference - matrix
Adjacency limitation (maximum number of connections for rooms) - array/property
Size preference (number of rooms?) - number
Relative room ratios - matrix

How to ensure there are not too many of certain rooms? Can't be more than one exterior, no??
-------
Is there any way to propagate adjacency preference further than just one step? So that you know if certain rooms are 2 apart, etc. Matrix multiplication?



The individuals need:

Variable size matrix
List of ids for the columns/rows
